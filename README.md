# ColorTypewriter
![][cover]
To visualize the using of words in books I wrote a little sketch for Processing. The program analyzes a given text file and stores the different words in an array. Every time the program finds a word twice it draws a line between them. The color and the height of the line depends on counts. The higher the line, the less it occurs in the text. For the picture above I used the book [„THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES“](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1661) with about 25.000 words.
To use your own text just replace the `data/data.txt`.
