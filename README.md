ColorTypewriter
===============

To visualize the using of words in books I wrote a little sketch for Processing. The program analyzes a given text file and stores the different words in an array. Everytime the programm finds a word twice it draw a line between them. The color and the height of the line depends on counts. The higher the line, the less it occurs in the text. For the picture above I used the book "THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES" with about 25.000 words.
